# **Loan-Approval-Prediction**

With rapid improvements in technology for today’s globalized world, the financial needs from people 
have shown a consequently vast rise in loan application requests in the banking sector. There are some 
attributes to consider an applicant’s eligibility for approving the loan. To lend money to borrowers, 
banks must undergo a rigorous assessment of borrower’s creditworthiness. This has been a major 
challenge where banks must deal with such evaluation. This project combines ML models for 
individual applicant loan request approval probability. In today’s world, as the banking industry is 
expanding so as the applicant’s population has been increased too. This approach helps the banks for 
decision-making to recognize qualified applicants from a population set. The outcome for this research 
would reduce the time taken for loan approvals and would be useful for both banks and loan applicants. 


# **INTRODUCTION**

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the 
eligibility of loan applicants based on their previous loan data and various other factors. The model 
aims to assist banks in efficiently assessing whether an applicant is eligible for a loan using various 
factors like cibil score, annual income, loan term and the amount of the loan. The model is designed to 
streamline the loan approval process, reducing the time and effort required for manual evaluations 
while maintaining high prediction accuracy. This solution can support faster decision-making for both 
applicants and financial institutions, improving operational efficiency and customer experience.
